## Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge

[The Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge) is a challenge intended to create an AI capable of solving reasoning tasks it has never seen before with few priors and few training examples. The challenge is based on Fran√ßois Chollet's [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547) paper which seeks to create a benchmark test for computers learning complex, abstract tasks from just a few examples. 

Here is an example of one of the many tests in the challenge, where there are 3 example inputs and outputs, and 1 testing input which the program must use to create the final image.

This website is meant to make it easy for people to record how they parse visual puzzles from the ARC in the hopes that they will inspire a program which can solve many of these ARC puzzles.
